# EnterpriseReady

EnterpriseReady is content-centric open source project providing guidance for people who build SaaS products (founders, product managers and engineering team leads).

The goal of EnterpriseReady is to nurture the shift of today's enterprise software narrative from "how to SELL to the enterprise" to "how to BUILD for the enterprise".

The content, in the form of SaaS feature guides, is based on studies of 50 leading SaaS application product packages, in-depth CIO interviews, and feedback from countless SaaS founders.

## Project Background

EnterpriseReady was started by [Replicated](https://www.replicated.com/), a company that helps enables SaaS applications to create an enterprise installable version of their product to be distributed behind the firewall. Our hope is for EnterpriseReady to create a common vernacular for founders, product managers, engineers, sales and customers alike based on our experiences with SaaS for the enterprise.

We know we're not always right... so we open sourced this, you can fork it, create edits, share it with your team and contribute back.
